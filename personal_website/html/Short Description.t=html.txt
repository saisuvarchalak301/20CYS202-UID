My Father is my biggest support system.He always supports me and gives me strength what ever the situation is what ever the place and time be .More than parents my parents be like a best friends with me.Their support matters alot to me.Both of them had a huge part in my life.I am really thankful to god for placing me in such a nice and beautiful family.We have health relation ships between eachother but we even  have misunderstandings which will be sorting out easily.My Biggest Inspiration is my family.They never force me to do the things.<br>
In one word My Family Is Everything To Me<br>
